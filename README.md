My Launcher started as an application that my 98 year-old mother could use to launch a small handful of applications easily without trying to find them in the Windows Start menu. I made the font sizes big, the borders colorful, the spacing wide, and limited the things that could be changed from the main window. As development continued, I made those things customizable and added new features such as pop-up windows and the system tray menu from the Tray Launcher app. You don't need to be a
nonagenarian to use My Launcher.
