The TLDataToMLData ReadMe file


Introduction
============
TLDataToMLData is part of My Launcher. It is used to convert Tray Launcher data to either My Launcher
list data or menu data or both.

A note on terminology. When this document refers to "List" that refers to the items in the main
window or pop-up windows. "Menu" refers to items in the tray menu. This is important to be aware of
because the list items and menu items are kept in separate files and the file formats are different.


Using TLDataToMLData
====================
After starting TLDataToMLData, select either the "Menu Items" or "List Items" conversion by clicking
corresponding radio button. The My Launcher file name will be filled in for you. Note that the file name
will change depending on the output file type.

The file name of the Tray Launcher menu data is set to the default location.

Change either file name if needed. Clicking the file icon on the right of either file name will bring
up an open file dialog. In the case of the My Launcher output file the default location will be on the
desktop.

In the case of the Tray Launcher file the dialog will open in the default Tray Launcher folder.
The filename for the menu data is MenuItems.xml. If Tray Launcher is not installed in the default location
or if you wish to use a backup, navigate to the appropriate location and select the menu .XML file.

Make note of the output file's name and location. You will need it during the import phase.


Converting the file
===================
Once the type of conversion is selected and the file names are filled in, decide if you want to keep a
copy of the conversion log by selecting the checkbox at the bottom to save the output to a text file on
the desktop.

Click the Convert button near the upper right hand corner of the window. The area below the buttons
will display a log of the conversion process. Any error messages will be displayed there as well.

When converting to Menu data, all Tray Launcher entries will be processed. When converting to List data,
Section Heading and Separators will be skipped since there are no counterparts in My Launcher lists.

Once the conversion process is complete, you can close the conversion utility.


Importing the files
===================
Start My Launcher and navigate to the appropriate maintenance type from the navigation (hamburger) menu.
Select List Maintenance to import items for the main and pop-up windows. Select Menu Maintenance for menu
items.

Once you have opened the appropriate maintenance window, click the "Import List"" button located towards
the bottom right. Use the open file dialog to select the file that was created by the conversion utility.
If you select a file that is the wrong type you will see an error message. Otherwise the converted file
will be imported.


Making Changes
==============
The conversion process may not be flawless, make any changes that you see fit.

Items can be updated by first selecting them in the panel on the left and then by updating the fields
on the right side of the maintenance window. Pay attention to the text in the colored area in the top
box, it will change depending on the item type.

Items can be rearranged by dragging & dropping them into a new position in the panel on the left.

In the case of List items, "Normal" items can be dropped onto a pop-up to move them into the pop-up.
While dragging over a pop-up the indicator will change to a rectangle. Pop-ups can be expanded by
clicking the chevron symbol to the left.

In the case of Menus, a "Menu" item or a Separator can be dropped on a Submenu item. Just like the list
items, when dragging over a submenu the indicator will change to a rectangle. Submenus can be expanded by
clicking the chevron symbol to the left.

When you are done click the "Save & Close" button. If you don't wish to save, click the "Discard & Close"
button.


Uninstalling
============
To uninstall TLDataToMLData, uninstall My Launcher via Windows add/remove programs feature.
