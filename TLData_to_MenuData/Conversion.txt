The TLDataToMLData ReadMe file


Introduction
============
TLDataToMLData is part of My Launcher. It is used to convert Tray Launcher data to either My Launcher
list data or menu data or both.


Using TLDataToMLData
====================
After starting TLDataToMLData, enter the file name of the Tray Launcher menu data file in the upper
text box. Clicking the file icon on the right will bring up an open file dialog that will start in the
default Tray Launcher folder. The filename for the menu data is MenuItems.xml. If Tray Launcher is not
installed in the default location or if you wish to use a backup, navigate to the appropriate location
and select the menu .XML file.

Next, enter the name of the My Launcher data file. Clicking the file icon on the right will bring up an
open file dialog that will start in the desktop folder. Choose a filename that is appropriate for the
type of data you are converting to, either list or menu.

Then click the button corresponding to the type of data you are converting to. The area below the buttons
will display a log of the conversion process. Any error messages will be displayed there as well.

When converting to menu data, Tray Launcher Section Heading entries will be skipped as there is no analogous
feature in My Launcher menus. When converting to list data, Section Heading and Separators are skipped as
well.

Once the conversion process is complete, copy the .json output file(s) to the My Launcher program folder,
renaming as needed.

Start My Launcher and navigate to the appropriate maintenance type and verify the data has been converted
to your liking. The conversion process may not be flawless, make any changes that you see fit and the save
the data file.


Uninstalling
============
To uninstall TLDataToMLData, uninstall My Launcher via Windows add/remove programs feature.
